            Dear Hiring Manager,
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I am writing to express interest in the position of Computer Programming/Robotics/Tech Teacher at
            Fusion
            Academy. With a master’s degree in Controls and Mechatronics Engineering and a bachelor’s degree in
            Aerospace Engineering from UC San Diego, I have a strong base in engineering fundamentals. In
            addition, I
            have multiple years of experience working and teaching in lab environments. Outside of engineering,
            I am an
            avid hiker, skier, and sailor who loves the central coast! I am excited to present my application
            for this
            position as I feel it’s a perfect match for my experience and aspirations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I have experience in teaching, curriculum development, personnel management, and manufacturing. I
            was the
            Director of Engineering and Chief Safety Officer for SEDS at UCSD, a multi-project liquid rocketry
            team with
            over 100 members and $100k in NCRF funding. I received hands-on training in manual and CNC machining
            and
            metrology equipment from faculty and staff. I then designed a four-day onboarding program to teach
            manufacturing principles and safety to new club members. Similarly, while working for COSMOS as a
            co-instructor, I taught high school students principles of robotics engineering, including how to
            operate
            manufacturing equipment (CAD, laser cutting, 3D printing), developed curriculums on computer vision
            in
            Python, and oversaw student-led projects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Through my previous work, I have come to love teaching and am excited to advance my career in
            education.
            This position would not only allow me to apply the skills from my formal education, but would also
            enable me to further myself as an engineer through interactions with students. I am passionate about
            helping others along their educational journeys through hands-on work; I believe engineering is not
            something that can be
            learned from a textbook alone.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I am eager to learn more details about the position and demonstrate my abilities. Thank you for your
            consideration.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Jonathan Van Hyning</p>
