            Dear Hiring Manager,
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I am writing to express my interest in the available Lunar Training Simulations Engineer position at Blue Origin. With a master’s degree in Controls and Mechatronics Engineering and a bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from UC San Diego, I have a strong foundation in engineering fundamentals across disciplines. In addition, I have multiple years of hands-on experience developing both mechanical and electrical hardware for haptic devices and liquid rocketry research. My experience as Director of Engineering shows my strength as a leader and passion for success. I am excited to present my application for this position, as I think it is an excellent match for my experience and aspirations.        </p>

            From my work experience, I have demonstrated my technical skill and strong leadership ability. I was the Director of Engineering and Chief Safety Officer for SEDS at UCSD, a multi-project liquid rocketry team with over 100 members and $100k in NCRF funding. I received hands-on training in manual and CNC machining and metrology equipment from faculty and staff and consulted university safety personnel on machine shop best practices. Using this knowledge, I designed a four-day onboarding program to teach manufacturing principles and safety to new club members and coordinated a workspace remodel to better comply with university health and safety requirements. The onboarding program also included a workshop for Ansys Fluent that I developed in conjunction with our propellant feed systems engineer. In addition, as the lead structures engineer, I used my manufacturing knowledge to design early landing gear concepts for a propulsive lander using Solidworks. I conducted structural analysis using FEA from Solidworks Simulation and Ansys mechanical to verify our factor of safety. I led my team in developing a manufacturing plan, sourcing parts and materials, and conducting design reviews among faculty and peers.

            My master’s coursework has prepared me with in-depth theoretical knowledge of linear and non-linear control, optimal estimation, motion planning techniques based in screw theory, robot decision making, reinforcement learning, and CFD. Through my research projects, I have been able to apply this theoretical knowledge. In the Haptic Helmet project, I developed a prototype helmet that delivers navigation instructions through vibrotactile feedback. This experience honed my skills in C++ and C# programming and deepened my understanding AHRS and orientation filters. For the Autonomous Vertical Lander project, I developed a thrust vector control system for an electric drone and designed and manufactured test equipment to verify state estimates and controller performance. The attitude control test stand was a 2-DOF gimbal that I modeled in OnShape and 3D printed. This experience diversified my CAD skillset, solidified my understanding of Linux systems, and allowed me to build confidence in using MATLAB and Simulink for simulation and control design.

            I love solving difficult problems. This position would afford me the opportunity to apply my engineering knowledge to some of the world's most difficult unsolved problems and make contributions to the betterment of humanity and the preservation of Earth.
        </p>

            I am eager to learn more details about the position and demonstrate my abilities. Thank you for your consideration.
